//  Enhanced history card with visual progress bars showing compression results.
//  Transforms boring file lists into satisfying achievement displays.

//  DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
//  - Show, don't tell - visual progress is more satisfying than numbers
//  - Green = success, make it prominent
//  - Every card should feel like a small victory
